            <p>The mission here at Pulp! is to provide original, quality content for your express entertainment purposes. What's more, we pledge to always be in contact with our listeners, accepting submissions and suggestions on how best to promote the program and help it grow.</p>
            <p>This podcast serves as an homage, a relic of a memory, to those rough pulp sci-fi and horror magazines of yesteryear, and thus we strive to bring you unique--and sometimes unexpected--content.</p>

            <p>Science is everywhere, and scientists can inspire a lifetime of curiosity and wonder. They can also make their work seem complicated and unattainable. The Science Night Podcast is a way to make scientists seem more approachable, which I hope will make the work more approachable.</p>
